# Reflection of laboration 3

## Chapter 2
During this project, I prioritized method naming. Inspired by the Clean Code book, I aimed for names that were so descriptive that additional comments were often unnecessary, truly trying to implement the "Use Intention-Revealing Names" principle at its fulllest.

## Chapter 3
Building on practices from Laboratory 2, I tried to continue the "Do One Thing" practice. By ensuring each method had a single, distinct purpose, I believe I largely maintained clarity and cohesion throughout my code.

## Chapter 4
My approach to comments this time was mixed. While I strive for self-explanatory code, I felt compelled to include comments, even if redundant. The book's concept of "Mumbling" resonates with me, as my comments sometimes felt obligatory rather than informative.

## Chapter 5
Utilizing Google Checkstyle proved instrumental in enforcing code structure, especially concerning 'Indentation'. It was a  reminder to align my code consistently, ensuring that elements like loops and conditions followed a predictable format, so the  readability became much easier.
