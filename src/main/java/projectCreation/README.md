# Project creation

## About
The two classes (CreateJavaProj and CreateJavaScriptProj) are responsible for creating a new project with the given name and type. The project will be created in the current directory. The classes are using my own api from the laboration 2 to create the project structure.

## Features
### CreateJavaProj
1. Purpose: Generate the fundamental structure of a Java project.
2. Structure:
- src directory containing the main application entry point, typically named App.java.
- README.md for project documentation.

### CreateJavaScriptProj
1. Purpose: Lay down the groundwork for a JavaScript-based project
2. Structure:
- Main script file, typically index.js or app.js.
- package.json to manage dependencies and scripts.
- README.md for project documentation.

## Dependencies
Both classes leverage the API from Laboration 2. Ensure the API is accessible and functioning properly before initiating project creation.
